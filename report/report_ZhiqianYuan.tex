\begin{abstract}
  Klarna AB is a financial company which provides payment solutions for the e-commerce sector, and they need to generate a lot of invoices everyday, which involves a large amount of tedious work, so they need a tool to facilitate this task. The new method of invoice generating consists of two sub-process, i.e. designing templates and make mail-merging between templates and userdataã€‚

  This project aims for implementing a system to solve the issues described above, it mainly targets on the mail-merging of templates and userdata, besides it also provides a prototype of GUI for designing the templates. The final goal is to realize the automation of invoice generating to the greatest extent, later in this report I will illustrate how far this goal is reached.

  This system involves many technique areas, the techniques mainly used are Erlang, Erlguten, Cappuccino framework, javascript, rubyonrails etc.
